Minutes from town and amenities - appr. 10 acres with great views and lovely mature trees around house. Fenced, shady back yard - New carpet throughout the home is earth tone- beautiful slate dining area, wood stove base and entry to home. PLEASE READ EXTENDED REMARKS: This must be a cash sale, due to the driveway access issue that has come to light. Please do not submit offers requiring a loan. Large living area off entrance (this home was built both as a 2 and 3 bedroom by builder). Nice spacious baths with travertine floors, master bedroom has a big walk-in closet and is huge! Great storage & areas to walk or ride--zoned for horses Locking Storage container included with home. Subject to court approval and possible overbid at the court hearing. Unfortunately, we have discovered a drive access problem with this home. The lot south of this one at 16250 and this lot (16300 Fetlock Dr.) were owned by the same builder before development. Part of the access driveway easement for this property runs across the corner of the neighbor's lot at 16250 Fetlock Dr. The title company could not find a recorded easement, so they told us they would not insure the access. However, now the original easement recorded when the lot was first sold has been located. In sales after that initial recording, the easement was accidentally dropped off. We have an attorney involved who pulled all the deeds and records on the 2 lots and also did a letter of opinion to the title company. They will not insure it as of now, due to the fact the neighbor is not co-operating. So, we do have a valid easement, however, it is now in position behind the two mortgage liens on the 16250 property, where the easement was originally recorded. The attorney sent a multiple page letter to the title company that was asked to insure it, and they just disclosed that they will be unable to insure the easement as it is. The lender on the first sale on the property declined to approve the loan because of the situation, so we are in the position right now that we must sell the property as a cash only sale to a buyer who is willing to accept the easement as it is and/or wait for a resolution to the problem after they purchase it.",private getaway minutes town amenities appr 10 acres great view lovely mature tree around house fence shady back yard new carpet throughout home earth tone beautiful slate din area wood stave base entry home please read extend remark must cash sale due driveway access issue come light please submit offer require loan large live area entrance home build 2 3 bedroom builder nice spacious bath travertine floor master bedroom big walkin closet huge great storage areas walk ridezoned horse lock storage container include home subject court approval possible overbid court hear unfortunately discover drive access problem home lot south one 16250 lot 16300 fetlock dr own builder development part access driveway easement property run across corner neighbor lot 16250 fetlock dr title company could find record easement tell us would insure access however original easement record lot first sell locate sales initial record easement accidentally drop attorney involve pull deeds record 2 lot also letter opinion title company insure due fact neighbor cooperate valid easement however position behind two mortgage liens 16250 property easement originally record attorney send multiple page letter title company ask insure disclose unable insure easement lender first sale property decline approve loan situation position right must sell property cash sale buyer will accept easement andor wait resolution problem purchase,distressed,distressed

Close in off of Savannah Hwy to get anywhere you need to and not have to deal with much of the outer traffic issues. This home offers hardwoods throughout most of the home. Walking into the home you'll first step into the full den/ living room area (13x18.5) with wood burning fireplace. Walking around to the left you'll walk into the separate dining room (10.5x12) with plenty of wall space for sideboards or china cabinets. There is a bar area that separates the dining room from the kitchen/ eat in kitchen area. The kitchen has room for expansion, if needed. Continuing to the left you'll see the attached laundry/mudroom that is not considered in the total sqft as the room does not have a HVAC register. The room can easily be finished with drywall to add an additional 55 sqft to the home total square footage. The front room, that was the garage at one time is the flex room and is considered the 4th bedroom. There is an area in this room that you can easily add a closet. You could also add a side entry to this room, if needed, for easier access to the garage or driveway. With it being the flex room, you could also make this an office, study, media room or a mother in law suite. The laundry area is behind this room, so adding an additional bathroom and redesigning the laundry room can work as all the plumbing is right there! It's on the left side of the home and all other bedrooms and baths or on the right side. As mentioned the right side of the home are the additional 3 bedrooms and 2 baths. The master bedroom has a long closet with doors on each side for entry. Both bathrooms are tiled. Open the linen closet door in the hallway. This leads to the Al Capone staircase to the upstairs finished attic area. This area is finished, with an HVAC register, but the center of the ceiling is less that 5' tall, at it's highest point, so the sqft is NOT added in. But this is a tremendous area for storage and/or a kids area. Continuing through this area you can walk into the unfinished attic space for even more storage that is partially floored. Walking outside you'll step on the 7.5'x8'deck area down to the fully fenced backyard. The 20x25 detached 2 car garage has a new roof and side entry door. The roof on the main home is believed to be about 5 years old and it is a 30 year architectural shingle roof. No HOA and NO flood insurance required. Bring your boat and/or RV!! Home is 2 blocks from the West Ashley Greenway, that you can bike, walk or jog to S Windermere Shopping Center or the other way down to the new 85.5 acre Stono River Park that offers wooded trails and marsh boardwalks on the Stono River.
